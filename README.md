#  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using Python and deep learning libraries. CNNs are widely used in **image classification, object detection, and computer vision tasks** due to their ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features.
